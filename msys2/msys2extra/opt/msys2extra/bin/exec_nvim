# This script execute neovim within a mintty terminal.
# normally, neovim (the console flavor) does not support
# mintty. To workaround this, nvim must be executed behind
# winpty (https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) so you have
# to install this package to get neovim console work with
# mintty. You may either:
# - build winpty nightly using the aforementionned github
#   repository
# - install a stable version using pacman: `pacman -S msys/winpty`
# This script relies on the `rootmount` script located in the same
# folder. See this script for more details.


# TODO: get this chunk of code from a reachable script in /usr/local/bin
#       and evaluate it just like a macro to avoid code duplication
